### Financial Analysis Chatbot - Documentation

#### **Overview:**
The Financial Analysis Chatbot allows users to ask about financial data of specific companies over different years. It can provide information on **total revenue**, **net income**, **total assets**, and **average assets** for companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.

The chatbot leverages **regular expressions (regex)** to handle various user queries flexibly, accommodating different formats for company names and years. It also features basic typo correction to improve accuracy in responding to user inputs.

#### **Predefined Queries:**
The chatbot can respond to the following types of queries:
- **Total Revenue:** 
  - "What is the total revenue of Apple in 21?"
  - "What is the revenue of Microsoft in 2021?"
  - "What was Tesla's total revenue in 23?"
  
- **Net Income:** 
  - "How much was the net income of Microsoft in 22?"
  - "What was Apple's net income in 2022?"

- **Total Assets:**
  - "What are the total assets of Tesla in 21?"
  - "Tell me the total assets of Microsoft in 2022."
  
- **Average Assets:** 
  - "What is the average assets of Apple?"
  - "How much are Tesla's average assets?"

#### **Features:**
- **Case-insensitive:** The chatbot accepts company names and years in any case (e.g., "apple", "APPLE", "Apple").
- **Year Variations:** It can recognize year abbreviations (e.g., "21" for 2021) as well as full years (e.g., "2021").
- **Typos Handling:** The chatbot corrects common misspellings like "revenue" as "revnue" and "the" as "teh".
- **Flexibility in Queries:** Users can phrase their queries differently (e.g., "What is the net income of Apple in 22?" or "What was Apple's income in 2022?").

#### **Limitations:**
- **Limited Data:** The chatbot is currently only set up to respond with data for three companies: Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.
- **No Dynamic Data Fetching:** The data used is predefined and static. It doesn't fetch live data or update based on external sources.
- **Error Handling:** The chatbot does not handle queries for companies or years not included in the predefined dataset.

#### **How It Works:**
1. The chatbot listens for user queries.
2. It processes the query using regular expressions to detect the company and year mentioned.
3. It matches the query with the predefined dataset and extracts the relevant financial information (revenue, net income, total assets, or average assets).
4. The chatbot responds with the corresponding information or an error message if the data is unavailable.

This chatbot is an easy-to-use tool for getting financial insights based on a fixed dataset and is intended for quick look-ups of key financial metrics for a few companies.
